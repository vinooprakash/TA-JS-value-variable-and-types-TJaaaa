/* Switch Statement

 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take a number value from user and alert the message if it matches the conditions.
* [ ] ONE, if `number` is equal to 1.
* [ ] TWO, if `number` is equal to 2.
* [ ] THREE, if `number` is equal to 3.
* [ ] FOUR, if `number` is equal to 4.
* [ ] FIVE, if `number` is equal to 5.
* [ ] SIX, if `number` is equal to 6.
* [ ] SEVEN, if `number` is equal to 7.
* [ ] EIGHT, if `number` is equal to 8.
* [ ] NINE, if `number` is equal to 9.
* [ ] PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if  is none of the above.

/*
🎖Using switch statement do the following

 🎖Make a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

  ⛑ Rule
    * [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
